Project Title: Weather Prediction using Machine Learning 
Problem Description: 
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict weather conditions in advance. By leveraging historical weather data, the aim is to create a model that can forecast future weather patterns with high precision. 
 
Data Exploration: 
 
1. Data Sources: 
The dataset utilized in this arrangement has been gathered from Kaggle which is “Historical Weather Data for Indian Cities” from which we have chosen the data for "Jaipur city".

In this project, we are concentrating on the temperature prediction of Kanpur city with the help of various machine learning algorithms and various regressions. By applying various regressions on the historical weather dataset of Kanpur city we are predicting the temperature like first we are applying Multiple Linear regression, then Decision Tree regression, and after that, we are applying Random Forest Regression.

Multiple Linear Regression:
This regression model has high mean absolute error, hence turned out to be the least accurate model. Given below is a snapshot of the
actual result from the project implementation of multiple linear regression

Decision Tree Regression:
This regression model has medium mean absolute error, hence turned out to be the little accurate model. Given below is a screenshot of the
actual result from the project implementation of multiple linear regression

Random Forest Regression:
This regression model has low mean absolute error, hence turned out to be the more accurate model. Given below is a snapshot of the
actual result from the project implementation of multiple linear regression.
